LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by lazy.nvim
<https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim> to make it easy to customize and extend
your config. Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or
using a pre-made distro, LazyVim offers the best of both worlds - the
flexibility to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a
pre-configured setup.


FEATURES                                                    *LazyVim-features*

- Transform your Neovim into a full-fledged IDE
- Easily customize and extend your config with lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>
- Blazingly fast
- Sane default settings for options, autocmds, and keymaps
- Comes with a wealth of plugins pre-configured and ready to use


REQUIREMENTS                                            *LazyVim-requirements*

- Neovim >= **0.8.0** (needs to be built with **LuaJIT**)
- Git >= **2.19.0** (for partial clones support)
- a Nerd Font <https://www.nerdfonts.com/> **(optional)**
- a **C** compiler for `nvim-treesitter`. See here <https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#requirements>


GETTING STARTED                                      *LazyVim-getting-started*

<

        mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
    <
- Clone the starter
    >sh
        git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
    <
- Remove the `.git` folder, so you can add it to your own repo later
    >sh
        rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
    <

FILE STRUCTURE                                        *LazyVim-file-structure*

The files under config will be automatically loaded at the appropriate time, so
you don’t need to require those files manually. **LazyVim** comes with a set
of default config files that will be loaded **before** your own. See here
<https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/tree/main/lua/lazyvim/config>

You can add your custom plugin specs under `lua/plugins/`. All files there will
be automatically loaded by lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>


CONFIGURATION                                          *LazyVim-configuration*
